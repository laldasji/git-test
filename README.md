Hello my friend, if you're on this page, chances are that you're actually my friend.
If you don't know me, I'm sure you've lost your way.
Remember, do NOT play with fire, or electricity, unless you're a cook or an electrician. I mean if you're an electrician, you can still not play with fire, so I don't see the point in saying what I said, but yeah anyway.

I'm not sure you belong here.

Trust me, there's nothing of your interest.
